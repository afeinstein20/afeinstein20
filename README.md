### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
I'm Adina. I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Chicago trying to understand the interaction between baby stars and planets!


#### ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 
- Characterizing stellar flares in the ultraviolet and understanding their impacts on close-in exoplanets
- Developing open-source software to reduce data from the James Webb Space Telescope!

#### ğŸ’­ I'm currently thinking about
- Using stellar flare rates as a new metric to constrain stellar ages
- Disentangling chemical signatures of a star from planet
